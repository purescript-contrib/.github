# PureScript Contributors

The Contributors organization was started by PureScript core members and PureScript users to maintain libraries held in common. It can be seen as an extension of the official PureScript organization which is less selective about membership and which is open to a broader set of libraries.

The Contributors organization is also a great way for newcomers to PureScript to get their start contributing to open source in PureScript. One of our goals is to encourage new members of the community to feel welcome contributing to the ecosystem.

The [governance](https://github.com/purescript-contrib/governance) repository contains discussion and guides, including:

- The [contributing](https://github.com/purescript-contrib/governance/blob/main/contributing.md) guide helps new contributors get started with their first contributions to a member library.
- The [library guidelines](https://github.com/purescript-contrib/governance/blob/main/library-guidelines.md) guide outlines expectations for each library in the organization, including minimum requirements for maintenance, repository structure, documentation, and testing.
- The [contrib-updater](https://github.com/purescript-contrib/governance/blob/main/updater) CLI tool helps maintainers with tasks like standardizing repositories, setting issue labels, migrating new libraries into the organization, and more. It also includes templates for common files like READMEs, continuous integration, and more.
