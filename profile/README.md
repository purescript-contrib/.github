The Contributors organization was started by PureScript core members and PureScript users to maintain libraries held in common. It is open to a larger membership and set of libraries than the [PureScript core organization](https://github.com/purescript). 

The Contributors organization is a great way to start contributing to PureScript. We welcome new members of the community.

The [governance](https://github.com/purescript-contrib/governance) repository contains discussion and guides, including:

- The [contributing](https://github.com/purescript-contrib/governance/blob/main/contributing.md) guide helps new contributors get started with their first contributions to a member library.
- The [library guidelines](https://github.com/purescript-contrib/governance/blob/main/library-guidelines.md) guide outlines expectations for each library in the organization, including minimum requirements for maintenance, repository structure, documentation, and testing.
- The [contrib-updater](https://github.com/purescript-contrib/governance/blob/main/updater) CLI tool helps maintainers with tasks like standardizing repositories, setting issue labels, migrating new libraries into the organization, and more. It also includes templates for common files like READMEs, continuous integration, and more. 
- The [Pursuit publishing instructions](https://github.com/purescript-contrib/governance/blob/main/pursuit-preregistry.md).

There is a public [#contrib](https://discord.com/channels/864614189094928394/938253816862736405) channel on the PureScript Discord. ([invitation to Discord](https://purescript.org/chat))
